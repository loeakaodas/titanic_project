# Titanic Data Analysis Project

This is my attempt at the Udacity Data Analyst Project (Titanic dataset). All the analysis & code is in the IPyhon [notebook](titanic_project.ipynb).

Primary source of information about the data was referenced from kaggle, pandas docs, and a few StackOverflow pages.
