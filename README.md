# Titanic Data Analysis Project

This is my attempt at the Udacity Data Analyst Project (Titanic dataset). All the analysis & code is in the IPyhon [notebook](titanic_project.ipynb).

Primary source of information for the analysis was referenced from kaggle, pandas/matplotlib/seaborn docs, and a lot of StackOverflow pages.
